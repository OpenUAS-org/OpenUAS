# OpenUAS – Vision

## Open Source Universal Authentication System

---

## Why OpenUAS Exists

The digital world is increasingly fragile.

Passwords are still the dominant authentication mechanism, despite being
fundamentally incompatible with human behavior and modern threat models.
Users are expected to remember dozens of unique secrets, recognize phishing
attempts, and correctly react under pressure. This expectation is unrealistic
and unsafe.

As a result:

- credential reuse is widespread
- phishing remains one of the most effective attack vectors
- large-scale credential breaches cause systemic damage
- identity control is increasingly centralized in the hands of a few actors

OpenUAS exists to address these problems at their root.

## The Core Problem

Security systems that rely on human discipline inevitably fail.

Any authentication model that requires users to:

- remember secrets
- recognize fake services
- make correct security decisions repeatedly

will eventually be bypassed, misused, or abandoned.

At the same time, centralizing identity under large providers concentrates
power, creates single points of failure, and exposes society to abuse,
surveillance, and coercion.

The problem is not the lack of cryptography.
The problem is how trust, identity, and power are structured.

---

## The OpenUAS Vision

OpenUAS envisions a world where:

- Authentication does not depend on passwords or shared secrets
- Security is structural, not behavioral
- Users are not required to understand security to be protected by it
- Identity is not owned or mediated by a central authority
- No single organization can impersonate, lock out, or surveil users
- Trust is based on verifiable behavior, not reputation or brand

OpenUAS is not a product.
It is a public digital infrastructure.

## What OpenUAS Is

OpenUAS is:

- An open protocol for universal authentication
- Phishing-resistant by design
- Privacy-preserving by default
- Compatible with web and native applications
- Designed for global adoption
- Governed by transparency and verifiable rules
- Implementable by anyone
- Controlled by no one

---

## What OpenUAS Is Not

OpenUAS is NOT:

- A login provider
- An identity broker
- A user database
- A surveillance system
- A commercial platform
- A replacement for authorization systems
- A vendor-controlled ecosystem

OpenUAS does not aim to replace existing services.
It aims to replace unsafe assumptions.

---

## Human-Centered Security

OpenUAS is designed for real people.

Security mechanisms must work for:

- non-technical users
- elderly users
- users under stress
- users who make mistakes

The best security system is the one that remains secure even when users do not
behave perfectly.

OpenUAS treats usability as a security requirement, not a convenience.

---

## Decentralization Without Chaos

OpenUAS does not equate decentralization with the absence of structure.

Instead, it promotes:

- decentralization of power
- centralization of rules
- transparency of behavior
- interoperability through conformance

Forking is allowed.
Compatibility is earned.

This balance ensures freedom without fragmentation.

---

## Governance Philosophy

OpenUAS governance is built to prevent capture.

No individual, organization, or government should be able to:

- unilaterally control the system
- silently change its behavior
- force adoption through coercion
- compromise user security for external interests

Governance is based on:

- open processes
- public specifications
- verifiable compliance
- limited and rotating roles

Authority is replaced by accountability.

---

## Ethics Before Adoption

OpenUAS prioritizes long-term societal benefit over short-term adoption.

Security and privacy principles must not be weakened to:

- increase usage metrics
- attract investment
- simplify marketing
- satisfy commercial pressure

If a choice must be made, OpenUAS chooses ethics.

---

## A Public Good

OpenUAS is intended to become a public good.

Like the internet protocols it is inspired by, its value increases when:

- no one owns it
- everyone can implement it
- everyone can audit it
- everyone can trust it

The ultimate success of OpenUAS is not dominance, but irrelevance:
a future where strong authentication is invisible, universal, and taken for
granted.

---

## A Call to Build

OpenUAS invites developers, researchers, security engineers, and organizations
who share these values to contribute.

Not to control.
Not to dominate.
But to build something that makes the digital world safer for everyone.
